# Comparative Analysis of Cloud Services Across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

## Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) represent the dominant players in the cloud computing industry. Although each provider offers a distinct ecosystem and branding, their core services align closely across key domains such as compute, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, and developer operations. This report analyzes the similarities and differences among equivalent services from these providers, based on the table above.

---
