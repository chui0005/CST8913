#  Zero Trust Landing Zone for CloudMed Solutions

## 1. Company Overview
### CloudMed Solutions Inc. – Business and Services

CloudMed Solutions Inc. is a multinational healthcare technology provider specializing in secure, cloud-based digital health platforms. Its flagship product, **MedConnect**, delivers a unified telemedicine and patient-management experience for hospitals, clinics, and healthcare networks across Canada, the United States, and Europe. 

Core services include:

- Secure telehealth consultations between clinicians and patients.

- Electronic medical record (EMR) management with strict health-data protections.

- AI-driven diagnostic and health-analytics tooling to support clinical decision-making.

CloudMed operates globally and delivers its SaaS-based healthcare services from multiple Azure regions, primarily **Canada Central** and **West Europe**, to ensure data locality, compliance, and low-latency user experiences.

### Why CloudMed Must Adopt a Zero Trust Architecture in Azure

Because CloudMed processes highly sensitive health information, it faces elevated exposure to cyber threats and regulatory scrutiny. 

A Zero Trust architecture is essential for:

- Protecting PHI/PII in a hostile threat landscape where healthcare is a top target for ransomware and data breaches.

- Ensuring secure remote access for physicians, nurses, and administrators connecting from hospitals, home offices, and external clinics.

- Establishing strong identity-driven access controls for a diverse user base that includes internal teams, partner hospitals, and automated services.

- Enforcing continuous verification of identity, device posture, and session risk across all interaction points.

Zero Trust allows CloudMed to mitigate breach impact, maintain service availability, and ensure end-to-end protection across its telemedicine and data-management ecosystem.

### Key Compliance and Operational Drivers

CloudMed must align its cloud environment with multiple healthcare and privacy regulatory frameworks:

#### Regulatory Compliance Requirements

- HIPAA (USA): strict controls around PHI storage, transmission, auditability, and access management.

- GDPR (EU): data residency, consent management, encryption requirements, and data-minimization principles.

- PIPEDA (Canada): mandates for safeguarding personal health information and ensuring breach transparency.

These laws require robust identity controls, network isolation, encryption, audit logging, and continuous monitoring, all of which are core Zero Trust capabilities.

#### Operational and Architectural Drivers

- Multi-region operations (Canada Central, West Europe) require standardized governance, policies, and secure connectivity.

- Centralized governance and management to maintain consistency across environments, subscriptions, and workloads.

- Enhanced visibility through monitoring, logging, and compliance tracking for regulated healthcare workloads.

- Cost governance to control spending across global deployments.

- Secure workload isolation to support tenant-specific or region-specific healthcare partners.

Together, these drivers make a Zero Trust Azure Landing Zone mandatory for CloudMed’s cloud strategy, ensuring security, compliance, scalability, and operational resilience for healthcare workloads.
